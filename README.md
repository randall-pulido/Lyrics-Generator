# Lyrics Generator

I developed this python project out of my love for listening to, writing, and 
playing music. Modern technology has contributed to helping artists sharpen their craft 
and explore the full breadth of their creativity for many decades. ML can certainly 
be utilized for these aims as well, and that was the main goal that I had in mind when 
I decided to start this project. Not only could I have fun reading computer 
generated lyrics, but maybe I could incorporate them into a unique song and write 
guitar chords to accompany them. 

The project is still a work in progress. Some adjustments that need to be made include:
* Improving the data cleaning process to filter out erroneous tokens.
* Optimizing the architecture of the LSTM.
* Creating a UI.

I took inspiration and adapted code from [this ActiveState article](https://www.activestate.com/blog/how-to-build-a-lyrics-generator-with-python-recurrent-neural-networks/)
and [this Machine Learning Mastery article](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-word-level-neural-language-model-in-keras/).

# Lyrics Generator

I developed this python project out of my love for listening to, writing, and 
playing music. Modern technology has contributed to helping artists sharpen their craft 
and explore the full breadth of their creativity for many decades. ML can certainly 
be utilized for these aims as well, and that was the main goal that I had in mind when 
I decided to start this project. Not only could I have fun reading computer 
generated lyrics, but maybe I could incorporate them into a unique song and write 
guitar chords to accompany them. A lesser and far less wholesome goal that I hope to
come out of this project is to annoy my roommate and longtime friend, who despises 
coutry music, especially country love songs. I'd like to automate the lyrics generation process 
such that every morning, when he wakes up, the first thing that he sees when he 
checks his phone is a paragraph of country love song lyrics that he can (likely not) enjoy
straight from my model.

I took inspiration (and adapted code) from here:
